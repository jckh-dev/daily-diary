- swimming day. did both kids because Sam has her period (fair enough).
- took xavi by myself because kenzie was late to wake up
- took kenzie by myself so that xavi could get a good nap in
- took kenzie on a drive nap after swimming
- she woke up just prior to coming into huonville and she had been wanting to go to the park so we went to the one down by the waterfront.
- got some lunch there as well.
- while we were there Sam asked how long we will be. 
- I sent her a picture of Kenzie on the play equipment and said we'll be a little bit as it was an unscheduled play stop.
- sams reply was that i shouldn't take too long because the lawn should be done this afternoon before the rain that's meant to come during the week. 
- now in isolation, this seems fairly innocuous. But taken in with other 'little comments' like this that suddenly change the entire priority of the day, it's starts to seem a little less so. 
- like there had been no previous discussion about anything to do with the lawn, not even when the mower was dropped back the previous morning and i did a gardening job-- never came up.
- but all of a sudden, we're out and about and now is thought to be a good time to mention 'well actually i think you should get home so this can be done..". 
- couple this with the fact i got home at about 3ish (plenty of time to do the lawn before sundown) but not even a mention when i get home. Nope, i go and take xavi for another nap (again, like the previous day not unhappy about that, i was pretty tired at that point haha!) but like... why mention it while we're at huonville of all places. Kenzie definitely wanted to play more but i purposefully cut things short because of that comment.
- she had done maybe a couple of loads of washing and hung it up inside, folded some already clean and dry stuff that had been sitting in baskets for over a week.
- floors still incredibly messy and kitchen untouched
- after waking up from the nap with xavi at around 4ish i've finally had enough of the mess and start to furiously start cleaning in the dinning room/kitchen. 
- first the floors: clear the tables, wipe them down, lots onto the floor, then vacuum and steam clean. 
- i got the floors done before going out the get takeaway for dinner. 
- after serving up, eating and doing showers and put downs, i continue cleaning from about 8.30ish through untill just before midnight. 
- i get the entire kitchen clean, two loads in the dishwasher, the play corner completely tidied, the tv area all packed up, all floors in the living room swept up, mat is shaken out and ditritus swept up, couch spot cleaned. (see photos.)
