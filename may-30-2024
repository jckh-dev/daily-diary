- got the kids fed, dressed and ready for little messy learners while she spent over 1 HOUR in the shower/bathroom getting ready.
- worked from home but had to start late because i was needed to keep helping in order for them to leave on time instead of preparing myself for my work day.
- She unpacked and packed the dishwasher after 3 DAYS since i put the last load on.
- finished work just before 5. started cooking dinner, put on a load of washing and put a load in the dryer, watered some plants while food cooking. 
- showered both kids and got them dressed and ready for bed. 
- read stories to kenzie until we swapped and i took xavi while she did the put down with kenzie. She can't put Xavi down without waking him apparently, so we have to swap every single night like this. when i've been sick recently however, she somehow managed to get him down in no longer period of time than it would take me sometimes (he has to lie on me for a while to go into a deeper sleep before i can put him down successfully)
- just before 9 managed to have Xavi down
- swept kitchen and dinning room, wiped floor around kids seats, cleared plates and wiped down bench before coming to write this. 
- she has not contributed to any other chores apart from the dishwasher today (did nothing/continued eating while i showered kids)
