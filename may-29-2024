- left for work just before 7am. arrived at shops at ~5pm to do food shopping for dinner as no food in house for meal. 
- didn't even say hello to me and barely acknowledged me when arrived at shops with kids
- looked like she was not in control of her emotions at all, huge scowl, felt like i was being targetted as the cause of her state of emotions, constantly correcting and admonishing kenzie for straying even slightly.
- indicated that she could not control the kids during the day due to them 'being at eachother'. needed help to seperate them from deb. 
- beanie hit xavie while in the living room where Sam was supervising them, i was in the kitchen organising dinner. (never had this happen before while i've been watching them...)
- no (*None*) cleaning had been done throughout the day. Kitchen had additional mess from the day, food scraps on kitchen bench and table, kitty litter still in dinning room and not cleaned. raw egg from cake not wiped down off bench raising risk of cross contamination greatly.
- living room strewn with toys everywhere to the point of danger of slipping over. 
- no clothes had been sorted and put away

**note: i had left the dirty dishes after cooking the previous night to see if she would be proactive at all. will continue to leave them to see if she will at some stage attempt to clean them by herself without me prompting or just doing them myself (which i usually do anyway.. just want to see if it gets to a tipping point where she'll actually do them proactively or not before we totally run out of dishes)
