Today was the day that we had the counsellors session and Sam told me she can support 'me' moving to Brisbane but she can't. 
Even in this decision there was such an acute lack of empathy on display.

- There have now been a pile of raw egg shells sitting on the kitchen counter from her cooking mini quiches the night prior. Nothing else has been cleaned up either. Prior to her cooking i had cleaned all the benches and the kitchen was relatively spotless. 
- it's now closing in on 8pm on this friday night, i could clean this all up easily but again, i'm just seeing if she will clean up after herself at all. If by tomorrow morning it doesn't look like she's going to clean up the kitchen i'll do it.
- I'm going to do my best to write these daily however they are an incredible drain on mental health, it's like a reverse gratitude journal. But even ready back over the few days i managed to capture, it has me thinking that as long a shot as it may be, i need to talk to a laywer to discuss the option of taking the kids with me as i am convinced that she does not have the capacity to provide a clean and safe environment for them to live in. 

Some notes from the past few days:
- have arrived home to the kitchen/dining room absolutely reeking of a FULL! kitty litter box combined with a full bin emitting rank nappy smells. she was cooking dinner amongst that smell...
- i've been spot cleaning toys all week because there has been ZERO tidying done, i keep coming home from work and the same mess plus more keeps building up (not being hyperbolic at all- i have not seen her tidy up toys once). 
- literally used a broom to sweep everything (including the filthy crumb laden floor) towards the play corner to then sort the toys and clear the living room couch area.
- has done zero clothes washing while i've managed to do between one and two each day (the build up of dirty clothes/towels/sheets has been insane the last couple weeks so i've been making an effort to try and put a load on before i leave for work and one on when i get home)

- on a weird positive, she has been cooking dinners more often, which coming from not cooking any is a lot. however, there's a pattern of being completely unable to plan the meals ahead and do the shopping with the kids during the day, leading to a number of days where we just haven't had anything to cook and had to resort to take out.
