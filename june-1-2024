- today, saturday, I had a gardening job i had to make up for due to poor weather during the week.
- i had added the appointment to calendar, and had to start later than scheduled due to Sams sister having the lawn mower and didn't know about it
- Sam once again demonstrating that she doesn't pay much attention to the calendar because even though on the original day i told her i had to reschedule, it would have been in the calendar for 5 days at that point. 
- i get an email alert every time she changes or adds an event. I changed the settings on the calendar so that she should get the same kinds of notifications.
- in the past she's said she doesn't get them, but i always wondered if shed set them to spam or blocked them at some point. regardless, i had only reminded her the day before that the calendar is 'gospel' so to speak.
- when i had to come home to get the fuel can for the mower, was met with a 
        - "oh so you're not home yet" 
        - 'nah not yet, just had to get the fuel'
        - "how long are you going to be"
        - i'll be a couple hours yet
        - "mmmm" *queue visibly annoyed look and tone*
        - 'is there something wrong?'
        - 'no... don't worry' *annoyed tone and sour look on face*
- couldn't believe it again.... like i wasn't down at the pub sinking piss, coming home and heading out again, I WAS OUT EARNING MONEY (which we kind of need cos i'm still on intern rates..)
- again, i'm in the midst of a depresive episode and this just like another stab wound (or some other terrible cliche about pain)
- came home, showered and helped xavi sleep because sam is unable to get him to sleep on either herself or transfer him to the cot successfully for some reason? i didn't mind because he just slept on me and i had a nap as well. 
- the problem was, those photos of the house and kitchen from a 29th onwards, all the spaces had not been even touched yet and the kitchen was getting out of hand. nothing had been done while i was doing the gardening job, only more mess being made.
- why didn't i do it? most of my days have started early, had work, come home, cook dinner or entertain the kids, do showers for both, do put downs, and then i do some minor stuff like clear some plates and tables.
- honestly, i probably could have done it but i was more interested in seeing if she would take any action given things were approaching like... actually unsafe. so much clutter on the floor (slipping hazards on the tiles/wood flooring) and the kitchen after she did her soup was even more cluttered. she left tons of food scraps everywhere (that i did end up spot cleaning) but otherwise she didn't do anything during the day while i wasn't around to contribute to the general well being of the household.
