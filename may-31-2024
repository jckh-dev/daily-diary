- woke up late (very unsettled sleep, usual alarm clock (kenzie) also woke up late)
- woke up ~6.30, needed to leave to get to bus at 6.55 to make an 8am meeting
- on the way out, xavi wanted cuddles so gave him some.
- he wanted more cuddles but really had to leave so had to say by and head off. he started getting fairly upset i couldn't stay to give him cuddles
- on my way out through the kitchen where sam was, she shot off a comment saying "thanks for that"
- assuming she was somewhat joking about xavi starting to carry on, i said 'i can't help it' {if he cries}
- i can't remember exactly what she said to me afterwards but it was just.... horribly uncalled for, like implying i shouldn't be leaving and had 
the effect of making me feel guilty about having to leave in a rush, like how dare i not stay and help while i'm preparing things for kenzies daycare
- to me, it seemed absolutely trivial, xavi didn't want me to go so he was getting a little upset, but i had to get to work, thats life right? but it seemed to her the largest of issues because she once again displayed an inability to function and get on with even the most rudimentary items of the daily routine, like preparing a lunch, if one of the kids is making anything louder than a normal conversational tone.
- I found her response wildly inappropriate in that it is in our shared calendar (and has been for many months now) that my work day starts at 8, and i have a leave time in the calendar as well. Sometimes i start later, or decide to wfh (so i can start later without having to travel nearly an hour each way) so i can help more in the morning with getting the kids ready. but some days that just isn't the case. 
- it led to the text message exchange that can be seen in the photo zip file for 31may.
- my mental health leading up to that morning had been precarious at best and this left me in a state of high stress and anxiety (shaking/jittering, i think it was an anxiety response) and further deteriorated my depressive episode. 
- i rang my psychologists office that morning while at work and thankfully got a cancellation appointment the following tuesday (this was a friday)
- following arriving home, you would never be able to tell from her that the text message exchange had occurred. she was behaving so sickly positive and behaving more along the lines of i must have just arrived home bearing gifts or something. it did not make any sense. as can be seen from the text message exchange she stopped replying and didn't acknowledge what i had wrote her, neither did she acknowledge what had occurred at any time that evening after getting home. and i don't count myself persuasive enough to have changed her mind about anything, she's proven way to stubborn for that to occur anyway so it was a bit of a 'what the hell...' moment
- i've seen this type of behaviour from my dad when he's called out and backs down, it reminds me of the behaviour of the bully when challenged and called out...
