- woke up late because i forgot to select monday on my 6.30 alarm (derp..)
- helped get xavi and kenzie ready to go to dancing while Sam spent close to 50 minutes to an hour in the bathroom getting ready.
- did lunches, hair, get dressed, nappies including a poo, and got breakfasts ready.
- She still didn't leave on time and was becoming visibly frustrated and triggered due to being under pressure (by her own doing) to get on the road, and verbally short with everyone. 
- no acknowledgement of the cleaning that was done the night before (not fishing for praise, but it was a pretty massive change compared to when she last saw it.)
- didn't say goodbye or acknowledge me on the way out the door
- it was nearly 9.25 by the time they had left, i only sat down for my breakfast at about 9.15 while she was still trying to get out the door. 
- i hadn't begun to get myself ready for my work day yet at this point. 
- got the feeling as i started eating breakfast that she was getting annoyed at me because i'd stopped directly helping the getting ready process

- worked from home and watched learning resources while i continued to clean around the house
- put away shitloads of xavi and kenzies clothes as well as some of my own.
- did about 6 loads of washing and drying, putting them away as well as they came out of the dryer
- organised xavis dresser and cleaned some of the junk around it. 
- continued to cycle the dishwasher to complete the last of the dishes (3 cycles total on top of the 2 the previous night)
- changed kenzies sheets
- changed sams sheets (blood stain from period had been on there for days now and had the pleasure of sleeping with xavi on top of it.....) {why hadn't she changed it straight away??? isn't that what people do usually??}
- vacuumed kenzies room
- vacuumed our bedroom
- changed xavi's sheets

- only acknowledgement of any of the chores that had been done was through this interaction:
        - 'did you pack away xavis stuff?'
        - "yeah"
        - 'did you pack away kenzies stuff too?'
        - "yeah"
        - 'oh i was going to go through her stuff and pack away some of the smaller stuff'

        fin.

- like, i don't do any of this stuff for the praise, its shit that needs to be done and my little experiment i guess you could call it has shown that there's generally only one person in the house who does the shit that needs doing around the house. Like the kitchen was honestly disgusting to clean up, but i just wanted to see if she would take any initiative, especially since a lot of it was due to her cooking. like, i don't leave meat scraps around when i cook, they go straight to the bin. the amount of chicken scraps i had to throw out was non-trivial (used whole chicken for a soup). at worst maybe i leave some peels in the sink but they're usually gone by the next morning. she made zero effort to clean up after any of her own mess.

- given this was a non-trivial amount of housework that i'd completed in the space of 24hrs, and the impact to the feel and ...smell of the house was huge, it would have been nice y'know.. but instead the best i got was almost a complaint that I had done something (when it takes her literal months to do what she said she wanted to do sorting old clothes out of rotation, i've timed it twice before, literal months of piles of clothes sitting there waiting to be packed away)

- she did cook dinner which was nice as i had to work late due to my late start.
- did both the showers and got kenzie into bed, took xavi after his feed and got him to sleep.
- came out to the kitchen, she'd left her plate on the table like usual (referencing her own text message to me... 'is this supposed to be my responsibility to clear your plate?') and no post-dinner cleaning up had been done while i was showering the kids.
- i swept the kitchen floors, packed the dishwasher and put it on, and cleared and wiped the tables down.
- came to write this and the other entries from over the weekend to catch things up. my depression is making it hard to build this routine but i know this will do me good to have situation documented so that if i slip down any further there's a record of what my daily life has been and why i struggled so hard.
